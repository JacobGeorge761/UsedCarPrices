# Used Car Price Prediction 🚗💰

This project uses machine learning to predict the prices of used cars based on various features such as year, mileage, brand, and more. The objective is to create a model that can provide accurate pricing insights for used car listings.

## 🧠 Project Overview

- Load and explore a dataset of used car listings
- Clean and preprocess the data (handling missing values, encoding)
- Train regression models
- Evaluate model performance using regression metrics
- Analyze feature importance

## 📁 Files

- `UsedCarsModelEvalAndRefinment.ipynb` – Main Jupyter notebook for data analysis and modeling
- `auto.csv` – Dataset used for training and testing the model (add this if it's local)

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data handling
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Model building and evaluation
